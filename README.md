## What is this?

You can get access to various salesforce questions, but very rarely you get across a page facilitating you with various salesforce exercises. These exercises will help you improve and test your salesforce knowledge which will be beneficial even in the interviews. No theoretical knowledge is complete without practical know-how, and this page will provide you the required exercises related to every aspect of the salesforce. This will test your expertise about the domain — i.e. Data Types, DML, SOQL, GitHub, etc.
